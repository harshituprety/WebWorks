    <h2><strong>The Phantom Tollbooth</strong><small> by Norton Juster</small></h2>
    <p> In this childrens book we are introduced to Milo a young bored boy who recieves a package of the mysterious
        Toolboth. He puts this together and enters the booth to a new world to discover the wonder of numbers, words,
        and friends wth some problem solving and sage advice thrown in the mix. <br>

        <br> This is one of the first books I rembember getting out of the primary school library and I found it a truly
        enjoyable rolicking ride into the world of fantasy. Here everyday things and ideas are turned upside down and
        inside out. If you havent read it, then you should. It doesnt take too long. <br>

    <blockquote> "What Milo discovers is that math and literature, Dictionopolis and Digitopolis, should
        assume their places
        not
        under the pentagon of Purpose and Power but under the presidency of Rhyme and Reason. Learning isnï¿½t a set of
        things that we know but a world that we enter."

        it, as it was lost lost years ago. I imagine by now its quite rusty"<br>
